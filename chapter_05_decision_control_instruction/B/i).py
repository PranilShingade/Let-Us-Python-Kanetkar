'''a = 10

a = 10
if a in (30, 40, 50):
    print('Hello')
else:
    print('Hi')

# Output:
# Hi

# Explanation:
# The program defines a variable a with the value 10.
# It then uses an if-else statement to check if a is in the tuple (30, 40, 50).
# Since a is not in the tuple, the condition is false, and the else block is executed.
# In this case, the else block is executed and the output is "Hi".
# Thus, the final output is: Hi
