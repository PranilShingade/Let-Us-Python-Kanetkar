''' a = 10 b = 60

a = 10
b = 60
if a > 20 and b > 20:
    print('Hello')
else:
    print('Hi')

# Output:
# Hi
# Explanation:
# The program defines two variables a and b with values 10 and 60, respectively.
# It then uses an if-else statement to check if both a and b are greater than 20.
# If both conditions are true, it prints "Hello". If either condition is false, it prints "Hi".
# In this case, neither a nor b are greater than 20, so the else block is executed and the output is "Hi".
# Thus, the final output is: Hi
