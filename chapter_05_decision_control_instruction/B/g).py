'''a = 10

a = 10
if a == 30 or a == 40 or a == 60:
    print('Hello')
else:
    print('Hi')

# Output:
# Hi

# Explanation:
# The program defines a variable a with the value 10.
# It then uses an if-else statement to check if a is equal to 30, 40, or 60.
# Since a is not equal to any of these values, the condition is false, and the else block is executed.
# In this case, the else block is executed and the output is "Hi".
# Thus, the final output is: Hi
