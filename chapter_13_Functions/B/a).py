# a) What is being passed to function fun( ) in the following code? 
'''
int a = 20 
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
fun(a, lst)
'''

# Output:
# The function fun() is being passed two arguments: an integer and a list.

# Explanation:
# The function fun() is called with two arguments: a and lst.
# The variable a contains the integer value 20, so the integer 20 is passed as the first argument.
# The variable lst contains the list [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], so this list is passed as the second argument.
# Thus, the function fun() is being passed:
# an integer (20)
# a list ([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
# Therefore, two objects are passed to the function: one integer object and one list object.
